# The Data Analyst Course: Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp

## Course Description

- This course is designed to cover the basics of data analysis in Python.
- In the description of the course, it was also commented on what it is about, what it would be and etc...

## Introduction to Data Analytics

- In this section, we will learn about the basics of data analysis, what it is, what it is for, and etc...
- The difference between Data analytics and Data Science is that Data Analytics is more focused on the business side, while Data Science is more focused on the technical side and related concepts

## Setting up the environment

- Here the course instructor helped download and configure Anaconda, which I found very useful.
  Anaconda comes with anaconda navigation, an extremely good dashboard with all the necessary features to work with data analytics.
- However, I chose to configure vscode to use jupyter, as it is easy and practical and it is a tool I already use.

## Python Basics

- The contents studied in the Python Basics session were very complete. We study variables, types of numbers (boolean.. integers). We studied strings and how to work with them. We studied arithmetic operations. We study the logical operations. Conditional structures. We also study functions, how to apply concepts within functions and how to use one function within another. We create and study lists, using range. We work with repetition loops and also with dictionaries. I really liked the fact that the course is very interactive, I attend a class and do an exercise right after, it helps a lot to fix the content

## Fundamentals for coding in python

- Method

  - The object is one of its parameters
  - Belongs to a certain class
  - object.method()

- Function

  - Can have many parameters
  - Exists on its own
  - function()

- NumPy Package

  - This is fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
  - Very eficient

- Pandas Package

  - Panel data - Multiple observations overe multiple oeriodo data

- Jupyter

  - Jupyter so far for me is a notebook, we can make several blocks of code and, if we wish, run the features separately, this facilitates and opens up a range of possibilities for testing and for better performance of activities.

- Anaconda

  - Anaconda would be a conglomeration of functionalities, including jupyter, when I installed Anaconda navigator, it opened a range of applications that I can use, such as pycharm, vscode... it has a whole environment proposed for use.

- Documentation

  - There was a point in this step, which was well spoken about the documentation, it is valid for every programmer, to read the documentation of the application you are going to use, that way, you will have solid evidence of what you are trying to do and once you use the documentation will use the tool the way it was built, in the correct way

- Mathematics for Python

  - To effectively work with Python for mathematical computations, it is helpful to have a solid understanding of various mathematical concepts and modules. Here are some important areas of mathematics relevant to Python:

  - Basic Arithmetic Operations:
    Python has built-in support for basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Familiarity with these operations is essential for performing simple calculations in Python.

  - NumPy:
    NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computations and scientific computing. It provides efficient data structures, such as arrays, as well as a wide range of mathematical functions and operations. Understanding NumPy is crucial for working with multidimensional arrays, linear algebra, random number generation, and more.

  - Mathematical Functions:
    Python's math module provides a comprehensive set of mathematical functions. These functions cover a wide range of operations, such as trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (log, log10, log2), exponential functions (exp), rounding functions (round, floor, ceil), and more. Familiarity with these functions is essential for performing complex mathematical computations in Python.

  - Statistics and Probability:
    Python offers the statistics module, which provides functions for statistical calculations. This module includes functions for calculating mean, median, standard deviation, variance, correlation, and more. Additionally, the random module allows for generating random numbers and random samples, which are useful for simulations and probability calculations.

  - SymPy:
    SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It allows for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions, including algebraic simplification, differentiation, integration, solving equations, and more. SymPy is helpful for working with symbolic computations and advanced mathematical manipulations.

  - Plotting and Visualization:
    Python offers various libraries for plotting and visualizing data, such as Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn. Understanding these libraries enables you to create informative and visually appealing plots, histograms, scatter plots, and other types of visualizations to explore and present data.

  - Linear Algebra:
    Linear algebra plays a crucial role in many scientific and data-related computations. Understanding concepts like vectors, matrices, matrix operations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors is important for solving systems of linear equations, performing matrix manipulations, and implementing machine learning algorithms.

  - By combining Python with these mathematical concepts and libraries, you can perform a wide range of mathematical computations, data analysis, scientific simulations, and machine learning tasks efficiently and effectively.
