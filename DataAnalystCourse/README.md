# The Data Analyst Course: Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp

## Course Description

- This course is designed to cover the basics of data analysis in Python.
- In the description of the course, it was also commented on what it is about, what it would be and etc...

## Introduction to Data Analytics

- In this section, we will learn about the basics of data analysis, what it is, what it is for, and etc...
- The difference between Data analytics and Data Science is that Data Analytics is more focused on the business side, while Data Science is more focused on the technical side and related concepts

## Setting up the environment

- Here the course instructor helped download and configure Anaconda, which I found very useful.
  Anaconda comes with anaconda navigation, an extremely good dashboard with all the necessary features to work with data analytics.
- However, I chose to configure vscode to use jupyter, as it is easy and practical and it is a tool I already use.

## Python Basics

- The contents studied in the Python Basics session were very complete. We study variables, types of numbers (boolean.. integers). We studied strings and how to work with them. We studied arithmetic operations. We study the logical operations. Conditional structures. We also study functions, how to apply concepts within functions and how to use one function within another. We create and study lists, using range. We work with repetition loops and also with dictionaries. I really liked the fact that the course is very interactive, I attend a class and do an exercise right after, it helps a lot to fix the content
